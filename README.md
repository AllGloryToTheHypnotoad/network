Here's a link back to my [main GitHub page](http://troydhanson.github.io/).

These are templates for basic techniques for C network programs on Linux.
These are all placed in the public domain.  

* A [TCP](/tcp) client and server in C
* A [UDP](/udp) client and server in C
* How to do a [DNS loopkup](/dns) in C
* Using [libpcap](/pcap) to capture packets in C 
* How to [list network interfaces](/ifinfo) in C
* [UNIX domain sockets](/unixdomain) in C [see notes](http://troydhanson.github.io/network/Unix_domain_sockets.html)
* my [qcp utility](/qcp) to copy files across a network with no authentication
